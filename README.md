Pre thoughts
---------------------
This project sounds difficult, I'm used to using enumerable methods at a whim
and never really thought about how they work. However, I'm excited about this
project because it will give me a better understand of Ruby itself.

Things I'm concerned about:
1) Utilizing bloc and procs properly
2) Accounting for hashes as well as arrays

Things I'm confident about:
1) After making my_each method I can use it to make other methods.
2) The more methods I make, the more I can use, the easier (hopefully) it gets.

Post thoughts
---------------------
This project was difficult, and I'm proud to have completed it. One real issue
I had was with the my_select method. Originally, I had accounted for hashes
incorrectly, but I eventually worked it out. Using 'self' was really helpful
(as I predicted).

Overall I have a gained a better understanding for Ruby and I'm happy with
this project.

I came back to this project and added some basic rspec tests to the methods
to get some practice with rspec
